As an applicant starting a new visa, I need to be able to:

* Start a new file to represent a new visa
* Create a to-do list of the various parts of my application - such as the different forms necessary and the due dates
* Have certain forms auto-generated for me based on the to-do list options I selected
* Save this file in a secure location anytime I need to

As an applicant returning to a visa application, I need to be able to:

* Open up my application file and have all my progress be where it was last time
* Update my information and save the updates as I go

As a general applicant (new or returning), I need to be able to:

* Keep a running list of various life histories, such as travel, housing, or work, organized with dates, locations, addresses, and other pertinent information
* Generate clean PDFs of the aforementioned lists using specific criteria (such as the last 10 years till today's date) neatly formatted so they can be attached to visa applications
* Save scans of forms, IDs, and anything else
* Key in dates of last contact, due dates, response dates
* Keep contact information handy (whether for application reasons, such as details of family members, or for administrative reasons, such as lawyer details)
* Have a calendar of important dates (possibly integrate with other calender apps?)
* Be prompted if I have not updated my life history lists in a while
* Have all my information SECURE and SAFE!!!!!
* Delete any information that is no longer wanted and have that delete be as permanent as necessary for security
